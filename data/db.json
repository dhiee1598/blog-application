It’s often used for coaching, consulting, guidance, personal development, spirituality, etc. They often provide free downloadable content such as e-books, checklists, guides, etc. The focus is on building a relationship with the audience for lead generation. This type of blog is successful when it empowers readers through to the call to action. Those with ads and affiliate sales will need to attract a large audience in niches that include lots of ad network and affiliate products. Those that sell their own products will either need a large audience or expensive products to sell. Those with the goal of being hired only need a smaller audience, but they’ll need to build strong relationships with their audience.",
